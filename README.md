Mechanic Online Course
Mechanic online course wants to know whether a different approach to teaching (for an large online course) has any effect on student outcomes.

Two groups (A and B)of students were randomly chosen.

Group A: No Practicals and test
Group B: Practicals and test
Each group consisted of 2 categories:

Cat 1: No background in subject
Cat 2: Have background in subject 2
We want to look at:

Whether group B performed better, given the practical applications and regular testing.
Which sub-group performed best in groups A and B respectively.
What other tests would we want to run to determine which improvements we need to do on the course.
